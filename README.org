* Purpose

Shorten file-names found in compilation output.  Linking still works, just the
directory part of the file-name is hidden.

This package is implemented as a minor-mode, /scf-mode/ (scp stands for
shorten-compilation-filename).  When the minor-mode is turned off, file-names
are restored.

* Installation

See library header.
